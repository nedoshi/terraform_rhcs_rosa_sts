# Simple single AZ cluster

This directory is explicitly trimmed down to have the minimum variables and configuration to make a basic ROSA cluster in a single Availability Zone. It is not intended for anything more than a quickstart example. For better examples, please see the other directories.

## Usage:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
